When something has just happened;Ow ! I have juste burnt my finger
When something has already / never been done;I have never been to New York City
When it is the first, second É time that something is done;It is the first time I have met him
Superlatives;He is the best singer I have ever heard
To establish a link between the past and the present;Pam is crying. She has seen a bad movie
